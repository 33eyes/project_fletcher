Roku has 15 million monthly active accounts which streamed nearly 7 billion hours on the Roku platform in the first half of 2017.

We generate revenue from selling Roku® streaming players in retail, licensing to TV OEMs and service TV operators, and enabling content consumption, promotion, and advertising on the platform. Roku employs top talent with advertising, billing, data, mobile, marketing, TV and software expertise.
