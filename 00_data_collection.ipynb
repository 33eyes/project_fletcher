A top US chemical maker (along with Dow and  ExxonMobil Chemicals), the company consists of 14 businesses that are divided into nine segments, each of which serves a diverse set of markets. Using its expertise in science-based development, it offers products, materials, and services that are applied in everything from agriculture, apparel, and construction, to electronics, nutrition, and safety. DuPont operates worldwide with most of its sales coming from outside of the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nOperations\\r\\n\\r\\nDuPont's nine business segments\\xa0include\\xa0Agriculture, Electronics and Communications, Industrial Biosciences, Nutrition and Health, Performance Chemicals,\\xa0Performance Coatings, Performance Materials,\\xa0Safety and Protection, and Pharmaceuticals. The company's largest segment, Agriculture, consists of the\\xa0Pioneer Hi-Bred International\\xa0and DuPont Crop Protection businesses, offering a\\xa0slew of products and services aimed at improving crop yields and productivity. Products include Pioneer brand seeds, as well as other insecticide, fungicide, and herbicide brands.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerformance Chemicals (fluorine products and white pigments) and Performance Materials (a wide range of polymers) round out DuPont's top three segments, which all together generate about two-thirds of the company's sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeographic Reach\\r\\n\\r\\nDuPont has operations in more than 90 countries worldwide. The majority are located in Europe, while\\xa0other operations can be found in North America,\\xa0Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The US and Canada account for about one-third of sales, while the remainder is generated by non-US customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial Analysis\\r\\n\\r\\nHigher selling prices and sales from businesses acquired from Danisco helped drive the company's fiscal 2011 revenues to a 20% increase over revenues in 2010. Sales in developing markets jumped 27% in 2011 over the previous year. Sales in the US were higher for titanium dioxide, seeds, fluroproducts, and electronic products. Worldwide sales showed strong growth in the Agriculture segment,\\xa0especially in Latin American markets.\\xa0However, declines in the fourth quarter hurt global sales in the Electronics\\xa0and Communications, Performance Chemicals, and Performance Materials segments. Demand softened that year for consumer electronics and construction industries.\\r\\n\\r\\nNet income in 2011 rose nearly 15% over the previous year, reaching $3.5 billion. The increase reflects higher selling prices in the US, higher sales volume and favorable currency translations. These were partly offset by higher costs for raw materials, energy, and freight;\\xa0increased spending for growth initiatives; and lower pharmaceuticals income due to patent expirations.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuPont\\xa0devised a five-year plan in 2010\\xa0that set annual growth targets of 7% for sales and 12%\\xa0for earnings through 2015. The company also plans to\\xa0get 40% of its sales by 2015\\xa0from\\xa0developing markets, which include China, India, and countries in Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrategy\\r\\n\\r\\nDuPont's general strategy for growth is to use its expertise in\\xa0science and technology to\\xa0launch products that will address global needs for food, cleaner energy (mainly reducing dependence on fossil fuels), and keeping people and the environment safe.\\xa0The company\\xa0introduced more than 1,700 products in 2011. However,\\xa0DuPont is undergoing a shift from being a chemical maker known for paints, plastics, and industrial chemicals\\xa0to a company that is trying to grow in certain high-growth, high-margin markets, such as agriculture and nutrition, advanced materials, and biotechnology.\\r\\n\\r\\nMergers and Acquisitions\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this end, DuPont\\xa0is buying and selling off some big businesses. In mid-2012, for instance, it\\xa0agreed to sell one of its larger units, Performance Coatings, to\\xa0The Carlyle Group\\xa0for $4.9 billion, as that\\xa0business focuses on manufacturing paints for cars, trucks, and appliances.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the acquisition side, DuPont in 2011 shelled out about $6.4 billion\\xa0to buy\\xa0Danisco, a global specialty food ingredients and enzyme company.\\xa0Danisco's businesses bolstered\\xa0its presence in nutrition and biosciences. To further position itself as a global leader in the specialty food ingredients market, DuPont subsequently in 2012 acquired full ownership of\\xa0Solae,\\xa0a joint venture formed in 2003\\xa0with\\xa0Bunge. Solae has been a global leader in developing soy-based ingredients. Solae and Danisco's food ingredients business\\xa0fall under\\xa0Dupont's growing Nutrition and Health segment.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuPont made a move in 2011 to expand further into clean energy by acquiring Innovalight, which specializes in advanced silicon inks and process technologies that increase the efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells. The deal is designed to strengthen DuPont's position in the solar energy market, where it made $1 billion in 2010 and aims to double that by 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, to meet demand for high-margin products with growth potential, the company made two major expansions at US production sites in 2011 for its Kevlar-brand aramid fiber (used for protection technologies such as bullet-resistant vests) and its Tedlar-brand film (used in photovoltaics for solar energy).\\xa0–\\xa0\", '', 'Join IBM.

It divested all of\\xa0its\\xa0non-pharmaceutical operations, shuttered or sold more than half of its manufacturing and packing facilities,\\xa0and trimmed its workforce by at least\\xa010%.\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nSales dropped in 2009 after a series of asset divestitures, but in 2010 and 2011 the company increased\\xa0revenues by 4% (to\\xa0$19.5 billion)\\xa0and 9% ($21.2 billion), respectively. As a result of its restructuring efforts, BMS also\\xa0reported improved profits in 2011, with net income rising 20% to $3.7 billion (after a sharp drop in profits during 2010).\\r\\n\\r\\nStrategy\\r\\n\\r\\nTo remake itself into a biopharmaceutical powerhouse, the company\\xa0must first add\\xa0more biopharmaceutical drugs and drug candidates to its pipeline.\\xa0And, to\\xa0give its plan more luster, BMS named it the string-of-pearls strategy. Since 2007 the company has completed almost a dozen licensing deals and major acquisitions in areas including hepatitis C, diabetes, and inflammatory disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollaborations are also an important part of BMS' development and marketing strategy. The company not only works with other research organizations throughout the world, it also engages collaboratively with physicians, hospitals, and medical schools. Its RandD efforts are focused on areas\\xa0of significant unmet medical need, including psychiatric, neurological,\\xa0cardiovascular, metabolism, oncology, bacterial and viral infections,\\xa0and inflammatory or immune system disorders. French drugmaker Sanofi\\xa0manufactures and distributes several BMS products, including\\xa0Plavix and Avapro. Japanese drug firm\\xa0Otsuka Pharmaceutical\\xa0co-promotes Abilify and certain oncology products. BMS also works to\\xa0expand\\xa0its offerings and fight off patent expiration losses by finding new uses of already approved drugs. For instance,\\xa0BMS and Otsuka\\xa0gained approval for\\xa0Abilify as a treatment for bipolar disorder in 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently approved\\xa0drugs in the company's cabinet\\xa0include Orencia (rheumatoid arthritis),\\xa0Ixempra (cancer), and Emsam, (major depressive disorder).\\xa0In 2011 the FDA approved its kidney transplant drug belatacept, marketed as Nulojix, and\\xa0BMS\\xa0launched Yervoy in the US and EU for treating adults with inoperable or metastatic melanoma\\xa0as well as\\xa0Onglyza/Kombiglyze for type 2 diabetes (developed with\\xa0AstraZeneca). Late stage drugs in\\xa0the BMS\\xa0development pipeline include Eliquis for prevention of stroke,\\xa0Dapagliflozin for treating diabetes, and oncology drug Brivanib, plus potential added indications for its key marketed products.\\r\\n\\r\\nMergers and Acquisitions\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012 BMS made a huge splash when it acquired\\xa0Amylin Pharmaceuticals\\xa0in a $7 billion deal ($5.3 billion in cash,\\xa0plus $1.7 billion in debt and contractual obligations to Amylin's former partner\\xa0Eli Lilly). The purchase\\xa0added new diabetes drugs to BMS' offerings, including Byetta, Symlin, and Bydureon. As a follow-on to the deal, BMS and\\xa0AstraZeneca\\xa0extended their existing diabetes collaboration partnership to develop additional drugs based on Amylin's technologies; AstraZeneca paid Amylin some $3.2 billion to gain access to those RandD programs immediately after the BMS acquisition transaction closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier in 2012 BMS completed another big dealpurchased drug developer\\xa0Inhibitex\\xa0for a whopping $2.5 billion. The purchase added Inhibitex's lead hepatitis C asset, INX-189 to its growing portfolio of HCV programs. Inhibitex's INX-189 is an oral nucleotide polymerase (NS5B) inhibitor that is in Phase II development.\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier purchases include\\xa0the 2011 acquisition of small-molecule pharmaceutical company\\xa0Amira Pharmaceuticals in a deal worth up to $475 million including milestone payments. Through the deal, BMS gained Amira's two key research programs in inflammatory and tissue-scarring diseases. Amira's lead candidate, AM152, is in early clinical testing for pulmonary fibrosis, a fatal lung disease. In addition, BMS purchased\\xa0development partner\\xa0ZymoGenetics\\xa0for some $885 million in 2010 to gain full access\\xa0to their collaborative\\xa0hepatitis C development program.\\xa0\\xa0–\\xa0\", '', '', ' ', 'McGraw-Hill operates by the book, or in this case by the textbook.

First incorporated in the Finnish city it's named after, Nokia's business consists of mobile device manufacturing and services, primarily running Microsoft's Windows mobile platform, as well as NAVTEQ (digital map content and services). Nokia also operates the Nokia Siemens Networks in partnership with Munich-based Siemens; the joint venture is a leading player in the telecom infrastructure and services market. With products in more than 160 countries, Nokia's largest single-country market, by more than double, is China, at about 15% of sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy region Europe is Nokia's largest contributor to sales, pulling in about one-third. Its business in the US generates less than 5% of sales, behind six other countries by percentage of Nokia's sales. Key RandD and software development locations are in China, Finland, Germany, and the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy domestic currency Nokia's 2010 revenue grew by 4%, but 2011 sales receded to €38.7 billion (about $50 billion), its lowest take since 2006. The company's legacy Symbian operating system continued to get hammered in the marketplace by Apple's iOS and Google's Android and its lack of devices that could support dual SIMs (memory cards) also contributed to the drop in sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmartphones are at the center of Nokia's strategy. Once dominant in the cell phone device market, Nokia faces increasing competition both on the device side and the operating system side. While the company is still a top three player in devices (behind only Samsung Electronics and Apple), its Symbian OS has long-since been eclipsed by the two main juggernauts. A key move to combat this, in 2011 Nokia began a major partnership with Microsoft, which includes a shift away from Symbian to focus on Microsoft's more competitive Windows smartphone OS. The company expects that transition to take about two years. The company further paved this road that year by outsourcing its Symbian software development and support to Accenture, effective through 2016, which included a transfer of 2,300 employees to the outsourcer. Nokia's partnership with Microsoft will also touch developments in other areas, such as Nokia's location and commerce business.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrengthening Nokia Siemens Networks' global presence, particularly in the US and Japan, the company picked up Motorola Solutions' networks business in 2011 for nearly $1 billion. The acquired assets include the company's GSM, CDMA, WCDMA, WiMAX, and LTE products and services. Besides the improved global visibility, the purchase also boosted its position with service providers such as China Mobile, KDDI, Clearwire, Sprint, and Verizon Wireless.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo gain ground in the US against device competitors, Nokia increased its focus on its core handset business by selling its wireless modem operations to Renesas Electronics in 2010 for about $200 million. The deal included the transfer of more than 1,000 employees to Renesas and plans for the two companies to cooperate in developing high-speed modem technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier in 2010 the company fueled its location and commerce business when it acquired geographic data and mapping software maker MetaCarta as part of its ongoing investment in technology to support location-based mobile services for wireless phones. Also that year Nokia it acquired Novarra, a developer of a browser and service platform for mobile devices. Nokia uses the Novarra software on its Series 40 platform, and other handset manufacturers employ Novarra's mobile software products, as well. It later bought US-based mobile application tracking and reporting service provider Motally to further enhance the wireless Web-browsing functionality of its mobile devices.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat year also saw the company bring in its first CEO from outside of Finland -- Canada native Stephen Elop, former leader of Microsoft's core business software division.\\xa0–\\xa0\", 'When we say \"Welcome to McDonald\\'s,\" we believe this applies just as much to our employees as it does to the guests visiting our restaurants.
